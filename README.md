# My Portfolio

I'm a software engineer shipping startups like a madman. Every project is a small bet, you never know what hits. I write about my journey and share my learnings. My tools of trade are React, Next.js and TypeScript for the frontend, then Python and Django for the backend. Database of choice is PostgreSQL.
